# bike_datalakehouse
In this project, I took raw bike sales data, transformed it, and performed aggregations. I then created a pipeline to automate the process. The entire workflow was implemented in Databricks, and the code was pushed to GitHub. The processed data can now be used by data analysts, the BI team, or other stakeholders to generate insights.
